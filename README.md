Euler Characteristic: Code for computing Euler characteristics from binary images.

Code for Dryland Vegetation.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook for processing images and generating Euler characteristic plots.

ðŸš€ How to Use
Prepare Data: Upload dryland vegetation images into the Dryland Data folder.

Run Analysis: Use the Jupyter Notebook to load images, compute Euler characteristics, and generate analysis graphs.

Save Outputs: Processed images and results are saved in the output folder.

Requirements
Python 3.x

Libraries: numpy, opencv-python, matplotlib, scikit-image

Install dependencies:
